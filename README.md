# ADHD-DETECTION-IN-ASD-CHILDREN-USING-HANDWRITING-ANALYSIS-main
A robust, GPU-powered deep learning system designed to detect ADHD, ASD in children by analyzing handwriting samples. This project leverages ResNet50V2 with custom CNN layers and was inspired by the need for early, accessible, and non-invasive ADHD diagnosis support—especially for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
